The software is called as "The Conference Agenda" and the requirements are listed under this section. 

To run software an input file is required. If no input file is provided the software will give error message and terminates itself. The software produces two outputs. First output is exporting conference agenda to terminal - with error and Warning messages. Second output is to a file which is called "ConferenceOutput.txt". If file does not exist the file is created. If file is already exists the file is updated with new output.
